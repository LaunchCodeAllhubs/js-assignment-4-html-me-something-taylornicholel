         <h1> Ghostly Booo-ty</h1>
         <p> There is a lot of gorey beauty (booo-ty) in researching ghosts and hauntings. While not everyone believes
            in ghost, many people recognize the "What If?" potential of these narratives. Both skeptics and believers want to prove their experiences. These stories are also another way to put towns on the map. Towns like Hannibal, St. Louis, St. Joseph, and Carthage in Missouri have their tales to share. On this webpage, we will look at just St. Louis for now. </p>
